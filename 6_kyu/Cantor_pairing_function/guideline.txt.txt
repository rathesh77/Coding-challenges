Georg Cantor's in one of his proofs used following sequence:

1/1 1/2 1/3 1/4 1/5 ... 
2/1 2/2 2/3 2/4 ...
3/1 3/2 3/3 ... 
4/1 4/2 ... 
5/1 ... 

So sequence is:

1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 3/1, 2/2, 1/3, 1/4 ...
Your task is to return nth element of this sequence.

Input: n - positive integer (max 268435455)

Output: string - nth expression of sequence - 'a/b' where a and b are integers.
