Boxlines
Given a X*Y*Z box built by arranging 1*1*1 unit boxes, write a function f(X,Y,Z) that returns the number of edges (hence, boxlines) of length 1 (both inside and outside of the box)

Notes
Adjacent unit boxes share the same edges, so a 2*1*1 box will have 20 edges, not 24 edges
X,Y and Z are strictly positive, and can go as large as 2^16 - 1
This is my first kata, so I hope every one will enjoy it <3
