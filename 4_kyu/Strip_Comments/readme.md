# Strip comments
Complete the solution so that it strips all text that follows any of a set of comment markers passed in. Any whitespace at the end of the line should also be stripped out.

Example:

The code would be called like so:
```
solution("apples, pears # and bananas\ngrapes\nbananas !apples", ["#", "!"]) should return "apples, pears\ngrapes\nbananas"
```
