## Content of this repository
You will find solutions of some katas i managed to resolve throughout my "journey".
Every solutions are sorted by the puzzles difficulties, from 8 kyu (the easiest) to 1 kyu (the hardest).

## About me 
My current rank is 4 kyu, which isn't bad. However i don't pretend that the solutions i provide are the most efficient ones in terms of algorithmic complexity.
